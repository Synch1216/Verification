#Merged the price and model stats from two sets. 

```{r}
setwd('~/Desktop')
getwd()
price <- read.csv('~/Desktop/week-4-price-data.csv', header=T)
price
model <- read.csv('~/Desktop/week-4-make-model-data.csv', header=T)
model
priceModel.df = merge(price, model)
priceModel.df

```

## The summary of the *priceModel* data frame
```{r}
#attach(priceModel.df)
#names(priceModel.df)
#priceModel.df[ModelNumber, 2010]
#detach(priceModel.df)
#priceModel.df[,1]
#priceModel.df[,8]
#attach(priceModel.df)
#names(priceModel.df)
#detach(priceModel.df)
#subset(priceModel.df, Year = 2010, select c("Make", "Model"))
summary(priceModel.df)

```


#4
```{r}
subset(priceModel.df, Color = "Red","Price" > 10000 )

```

#5
```{r}

#hist(price$price)

```
I tried to make a histogram of the distribution of prices but it would not render. Basically, what we can see from this analysis is that Camry was the most popular vehicle in the sample.
