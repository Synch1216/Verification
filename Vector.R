#1. Assign five individuals to a vector called queue:
> queue <-c("James","Mary","Steve","Alex", "Patricia")
#> queue
#[1] "James"    "Mary"     "Steve"    "Alex"     "Patricia"
#2. Update queue to reflect arrival of Harold.
x <-list(queue)
#x[["Harold"]] <- 6
#3. Reflect the queue as if James has finished.
#> class(x[1,1, drop])
#4. Patricia talks her way in front of Steve:
#>queue <-c("Mary","Patricia","Steve", "Alex","Harold")
#5. Harold grows impatient and leaves:
#>queue <-c("Mary","Patricia","Steve", "Alex")
#6. rm[["Alex"]]
#7.list[1,2]
#8. nrow(x)
