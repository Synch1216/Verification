This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
# age: continuous.
# workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.
# fnlwgt: continuous.
# education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.
# education-num: continuous.
# marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.
# occupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.
# relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.
# race: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.
# sex: Female, Male.
# capital-gain: continuous.
# capital-loss: continuous.
# hours-per-week: continuous.

#For a large data set like this it wouldn't hurt to bin data a variety of ways. One thing that I would like to explore is the correlation of age and hours worked in every country and it may give insight into labor standards in various countries.
library(scatterplot3d)
attach(newadult)
scatterplot3d(age,hours.week, country, main="3D Scatterplot")
```
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
